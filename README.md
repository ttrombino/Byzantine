# Byzantine Terminal Crypto

This simple program was developed to understand blockchain, cryptocurrency, and cryptography in general. 
The program allows a user to develop a blockchain using the Byzantine cryptocurrency to make transactions 
between other users. The user can also "mine" the Byzantine currency via proof of work protocol similar to 
Bitcoin.
